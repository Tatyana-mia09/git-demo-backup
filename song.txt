The path you tread is narrow
And the drop is shear and very high.
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby.

Apprehension creeping
Like a tube-train up your spine.
Will the tightrope reach the end?
Will the final couplet rhyme?


And it's high time, Cymbaline, yes,
It's high time, Cymbalin

I can hear the thunder
Coming from your mouth
And I know my number's up
Give me some Stevie Wonder
Quick, put it on before we go under
I can see the lightning
